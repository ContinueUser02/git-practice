**My own notes(git)**  
===============

-----------
### 1. $ git itin:       
 - The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.

### 2. $ git status:    
 - The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.


### 3. $ git add [file_name]:    
 - git add [filename] selects that file, and moves it to the staging area, marking it for inclusion in the next commit. You can select all files, a directory, specific files, or even specific parts of a file for staging and commit.  

### 4. $ git add. :   
 - adds all modified and new (untracked) files in the current directory and all subdirectories to the staging area (a.k.a. the index), thus preparing them to be included in the next git commit.     

### 5.$ git rm -cached[file_name]:    
 - The Git rm â€“cached flag removes a file from the staging area. The files from the working directory will remain intact. This means that you'll still have a copy of the file locally. The file will be removed from the index tracking your Git project.


### 6.$ gitignore file:   
 - It tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo. The .gitignore file itself is a plain text document.
